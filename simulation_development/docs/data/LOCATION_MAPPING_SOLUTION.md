# CedarSim Location Mapping Solution

## üéØ Problem Solved

The CedarSim system had a critical location mapping issue where SKU data locations (e.g., "Level 1 ED", "Level 2 ICU") didn't match demand data locations (e.g., "MDRER", "MDRICUPRO"). This mismatch prevented proper data integration and simulation functionality.

## üîç Analysis Results

### Original Issue
- **SKU Data Locations**: 14 unique locations using descriptive names
- **Demand Data Locations**: 36 unique locations using MDR-prefixed codes
- **Mapping Coverage**: 0% (no mappings existed)
- **Impact**: Complete data integration failure

### Solution Implemented
- **SKU Data Locations**: 14 locations (100% mapped)
- **Demand Data Locations**: 36 locations (100% mapped)
- **Mapping Coverage**: 100% (all locations mapped)
- **Impact**: Complete data integration success

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from data.input_data.location_mapper import get_location_mapper

# Get the location mapper
mapper = get_location_mapper()

# Map SKU location to demand location
demand_loc = mapper.map_sku_to_demand_location("Level 1 ED")
# Returns: "MDRER"

# Map demand location to SKU locations
sku_locs = mapper.map_demand_to_sku_locations("MDRSURGERY")
# Returns: ["Level 2 Surgery/Procedures/PACU", "Level 6 Surgical", ...]
```

### Data Integration Usage
```python
from data.input_data.data_integration import DataIntegrator

# Create integrator (automatically uses location mapping)
integrator = DataIntegrator()

# Load data (includes location mapping validation)
data = integrator.load_production_data()

# Create antology structure (uses mapped locations)
antology = integrator.create_antology_structure()
```

### Validation and Reporting
```python
# Validate mappings against actual data
validation_results = mapper.validate_mappings(sku_locations, demand_locations)

# Print mapping summary
mapper.print_mapping_summary()

# Get unmapped locations
unmapped = mapper.get_unmapped_locations()
```

## üß™ Testing

### Test Scripts
- **`test_location_mapping.py`**: Comprehensive testing of location mapping functionality
- **`analyze_unmapped_locations.py`**: Analysis of unmapped locations and pattern suggestions

### Test Results
```
‚úÖ ALL TESTS COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
üìä Location Mapping Coverage: 100.0%
‚úÖ Mapped SKU Locations: 14
‚úÖ Mapped Demand Locations: 36
‚úÖ Unmapped Demand Locations: 0
```

## üìà Performance Impact

### Before Fix
- Data integration: ‚ùå Failed
- Location coverage: 0%
