# Cedars-Sinai Marina del Rey Hospital
## Medical Supply Inventory Optimization Project

This repository contains the presentation materials for the Cedars-Sinai healthcare consultancy project focused on optimizing medical supply inventory management using digital twin simulation.

## Project Overview

**Confidential Core** has partnered with **Cedars-Sinai Health System** to develop a simulation-based solution for optimizing medical supply inventory at their new Marina del Rey hospital facility.

## Key Objectives

- Optimize cycle inventory targets (PAR levels) for each department
- Determine safety inventory targets for centralized perpetual location
- Minimize stockouts and emergency replenishment needs
- Reduce inventory holding costs while maintaining patient safety

## Presentation Structure

The presentation consists of 7 main slides covering:

1. **Introduction & Background** - Team introduction and project context
2. **Problem Statement** - Inventory optimization challenges
3. **Simulation Overview** - Technical capabilities and approach
4. **Pilot Phase** - Testing and validation methodology
5. **Expansion Phase** - Optimization engine and capabilities
6. **Simulation Inputs/Outputs** - Technical parameters and results
7. **Forecasting & Scenarios** - Collaborative approach and targeted planning

## Key Technical Features

- **Daily simulation capability** - Processes daily demand patterns
- **Three core dynamics** - PAR replenishment, perpetual replenishment, emergency replenishment
- **Monte Carlo engines** - Demand patterns and lead time variability
- **Multi-hospital scalability** - Star-shaped network architecture
